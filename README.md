## Project

Every time I am starting a new project with Next.JS I need to wire up the same few packages.

This repo contains a manual installation for a Next.JS project with a few packages (:memo: [list of packages](#list-of-packages)) installled and configured.

The configurations used here are based on the respective official repository (links provided).

Think of this repo as one of the examples in the [Next.JS's examples on Github](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples) but with `--example with-typescript-eslit-jest-cypress-husky-tailwind`
